## Exercise 2
### Sampling

First, let's sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution:

```{r}
set.seed(5)
sample <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```
### Histograms
Here's a historgam of this distribution:

```{r}

hist(sample)
```

Here's a histogram of this distribution on a log scale:

```{r}
hist(log(sample))
```

### Mean and variance
The mean of the sample is 2.817302 and its variance is 0.4644866.
```{r}

mean(sample)
var(sample)
```
